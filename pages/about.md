# **🧑‍💻About Me🧑‍💻**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>

I'm a student at [Konkuk University](https://www.konkuk.ac.kr/) and interested in **Image Generative Model**.<br>
Especially, I am studying <span style="color:#97C1A9"> **Diffusion Model** </span> , <span style="color:#97C1A9"> **GAN** </span> and <span style="color:#97C1A9"> **Variational AutoEncoder** </span>.<br>
Recently, I'm doing a research intern at <span style="color:#97C1A9"> **Korea Univ** </span>, **[AICVLab](https://kuaicv.com/){:target="_blank"}**<br>
<br>
I like to understand the process of reaching results rather than using them.
