# **🧑‍💻About Me🧑‍💻**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>

I'm integrated MS/Ph.D. Candidate at [Korea University](http://xai.korea.ac.kr/), **[AGI Lab](https://agi.korea.ac.kr/home){:target="_blank"}** and interested in **Generative Model**.  
I graduated from [Konkuk University](https://www.konkuk.ac.kr/)<br>
Especially, I am interasted in <span style="color:#97C1A9"> **Image,Video Generation w/ AutoRegressive Model** </span> , <span style="color:#97C1A9"> **Score Based Model** </span> and <span style="color:#97C1A9"> **Unified Multimodal Language Model** </span>.<br>
<br>
I like to understand the process of reaching results rather than using them.
